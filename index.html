		<h3>So I've seen the work, but who's behind On the Firefly?</h3>
		<h2>I'm <a href="http://www.jamestgreen.com">James T. Green</a>. Pleased to meet you.</h2>
		<img src="img/james.jpg">
		<p>I've worked with <a href="https://www.chicagopublicmedia.org">Chicago Public Media</a>, <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com">Uber</a>, <a href="http://blackgirlsrun.com">Black Girls Run</a>, <a href="http://www.soulcitychurch.com">Soul City Church</a>, <a href="http://www.redbikeandgreen.com">Red Bike and Green</a>, <a href="http://www.iron-wire.com/#0">Iron &amp; Wire</a>, and <a href="http://www.tribpub.com">Tribune Publishing</a>. If you'd like to see any of that work, <a href="">let me know</a> and I'll gladly send you some samples.</p>
		<p>I've been on panels at <a href="http://wmcfest.com">Weapons of Mass Creation</a>, and given talks at <a href="http://www.saic.edu/index.html">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.colum.edu">Columbia College Chicago</a>, and all throughout the internet. I also teach a graduate level writing course at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>

		<h3>A few more things about On the Firefly:</h3>
		<p><span style="font-weight:800;">On the Firefly is small and mighty.</span> I am a shop of one, and that allows me to nimbly take on new challenges, either meeting you on-site or at <a href="https://www.desktimeapp.com/some-office">my office in the Bucktown neighborhood</a>. While I may collaborate with other designers, developers, or illustrators for certain projects, 9 times out of 10 you will be working directly with me, from start to finish, and I like it that way.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight:800;">On the Firefly loves to work within the arts.</span> I'm also a practicing conceptual artist, so I have a soft spot for small businesses and individuals, with a preference for those in arts, education, and non-profits. However, if you are a larger business with a good head on your shoulders, or think we could be a great match, let's chat.</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight:800;">On the Firefly supports the community.</span> I pride myself in being an active participant in the Chicago design community, and supporting people of color and queer creatives. I have my own privileges, and any way I can build up those around me, I will.</p>

			<p>Great! You can email me at <a href="mailto:info@jamestgreen.com">info [at] jamestgreen.com</a> and place "On The Firefly" in the subject line. If you have a more casual question, find me on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/_jamestgreen">@_jamestgreen</a>.<p>Since I am a large supporter of <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/">deep work</a> and prefer to put all more of my energy towards making thoughtful things, I check email once a day, Monday-Friday, and my social media accounts a little more frequently. So be patient, and if your message is one that requires a reply, I'll thoroughly respond.</p>
