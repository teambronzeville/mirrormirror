		<p>Open Ended, in its current implementation, is a podcast in which myself, and good friend, <a href="http://www.chervincent.com">Cher Vincent</a> take a weekly dive into tech news and code, to code-switching and gender. All wrapped in the comfort of listening to two best friends disagree. Here's episode 38, one of our favorite episodes so far:</p>

		<p>Did you get a chance to listen to the audio quality? Sounds good right? However, it didn't sound that way from the beginning. Here's what episode 1 sounded like:</p>
		<p><iframe frameborder='0' height='36px' scrolling='no' seamless src='https://simplecast.com/e/7965?style=dark' width='100%'></iframe></p>
		<p>The origins of this idea came from two things: A) we loved to talk about the human side of technology and B) the majority of tech podcasts were headed by white dudes that seemed to talk in an endless void. We wanted to change that.</p>
		<img src="img/projects/openended/original_note.png" alt="The first note written about the podcast" style="float:left; width:35%;"><p>This is the first note we wrote about what we thought the podcast would be. We met up really quickly and decided to put ideas to action. Cher came up with the name after a long text conversation of spitballing names. Little did we know how much it would take over our lives.</p>
		<p>Open Ended has now sprout into its own business, complete with sponsorships and a much higher production quality all handled by myself. We record out of <a href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity's</a> wonderful soundproof studios and then I handle all the post-production work through a combination of Apple's GarageBand and Audacity. That episode at the very top is an example of our highly produced style.</p>
